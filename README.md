## Introduction

PICR Editor is a powerful terminal text editor inspired by Vim. It aims to provide a seamless and efficient editing experience for both beginners and advanced users.

## Features

### File Locks

Implementing file locks ensures that a file cannot be opened simultaneously by two different processes, preventing conflicts and data corruption.

### Multiple Processes

PICR Editor supports preventing the same file from being opened by two different processes, enhancing data integrity and supporting collaborative editing.

### New File Creation

If the file you want to edit does not exist, PICR Editor will automatically create a new file for you, streamlining the editing process.

### Auto Save

Auto-save functionality using separate threads ensures that your changes are periodically saved without disrupting your workflow. Auto-save intervals are customizable.

### Editing Modes

PICR Editor provides three distinct modes:

- **VISUAL Mode:** Navigate and select text visually.
- **INSERT Mode:** Add or edit text.
- **COMMAND Mode:** Execute commands and navigate the editor.

Switch seamlessly between these modes using intuitive keybindings, allowing for a fluid editing experience.
